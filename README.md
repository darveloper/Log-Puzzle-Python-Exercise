# Log-Puzzle-Python-Exercise
This is my attempt at Google's Python Exercise - https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/log-puzzle

I only finished part A and B in their exercise because the second file they presented was no longer working so I stopped after seeing the animal picture in the first server log. Also urllib didn't quite work the way they talked about. However, it was easy enough to find a solution thanks to Stackoverflow. After this exercise I feel more comfortable with using list and for loops. Additionally, this was the first project where I used sets.
